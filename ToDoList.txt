Log of actions to be implemented

- Improve question bank with 10 'levels' of question ... SORT OUT THE RANDOMNESS / ITERATION PROBLEM
- Crate a decent difficulty adjustment model for user rating (FIDE copy?)
- Improve the question scoring model to take into account user questions
- Implement a proper question selection method, best possible difficulty, non-repeated questions 
- Add Javascript to site for color change feedback and other interactive elements (ensure right answers are fun!)
- Maybe replicate for another area (eg French-English)

Lessons learnt by doing this

- devise is freaking impressive, especially always knowing who the user is in a helper method!

- Using a central responses table is a good way to go as you can access this from outside

- Controller routing is damn tricky
>> 'new' loads a new page, but forgets everything when you want to create (save), unless you store it in the url, the session or somewhere else
>> use the raise 'x' to check out what you are posting in a form
>> params hash is just whatever input the post request is creating
>> access nested hashes with the right syntax, eg params[:response][:answer]
>> define stuff in the session by adding it as a hash, ie... session[:start_time] = Time.now

- Establishing hierarchy
>> getting the resources right enables a bunch of awesome helper methods, eg responses.each (instead of trying to peer into the relevant hash)
>> enables you to work through the class hierarchy, in this case using response.outcome and then response.question.starting_difficulty

- Testing tricky formulae
>> Use the console as a testing vehicle
>> run the method on a specific class and follow through the stack trace

- How to use git effectively
>> think about a horizontal time path and a vertical version path
>> working on your own pre-launch, there is only really a time path!
>> for a new branch, use git branch XX, and then git checkout XX, and then git merge ...
>> use git checkout (tag) to look at  other instances in this or other branches
>> use git reset --hard --head to go back to last save (or tag to go back to specific one, but be careful!)
